## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the code examples, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster and some command-line tools installed.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Kubernetes Cluster**: You can use a local cluster like [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/).
2.  **kubectl**: The Kubernetes command-line tool. [Installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
3.  **Helm**: The package manager for Kubernetes. [Installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
4.  **Argo CD CLI**: Command-line interface for Argo CD. [Installation guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/).

### Repository Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/miguelgmcap/argocd-code.git
